# Historical-Audiobook-Sales-Analysis


Problem Statement:
              Conduct an extensive analysis of Audible's historical audiobook sales data spanning from the year 2000 to 2023, followed by the development of advanced machine learning models using Python. The primary objectives are to gain insights into long-term sales trends, assess the impact of historical events on audiobook consumption, and leverage this knowledge to create predictive models that can forecast future sales, identify potential bestselling titles, and optimize marketing strategies to maximize revenue.


Tools Used:

           1. Pandas
           2. Numpy
           3. MatplotLib
           4. Seaborn
           5. Geopy
           6. ScikitLearn
           7. Jupyter NoteBook

Summary:
      After importing the CSV file, convert it into a dataframe. 
      Then, clean the unstructured and imbalanced data to create a structured format. 
      Perform data cleansing, followed by exploratory data analysis and visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
      Finally, utilize the scikit-learn library to build machine learning algorithms. 
      Determine feature importance using XGBoost's feature_importance function.
      Finally, suggest the important features that affects both the Price and Sales of audiobooks.
